       *  @brief  Remove a range of elements.
       *  @param  __first  Iterator pointing to the first element to be erased.
       *  @param  __last  Iterator pointing to one past the last element to be
       *                  erased.
       *  @return  An iterator pointing to the element pointed to by @a __last
       *           prior to erasing (or end()).
       *
       *  This function will erase the elements in the range
       *  [__first,__last) and shorten the %vector accordingly.
       *
       *  Note This operation could be expensive and if it is
       *  frequently used the user should consider using std::list.
       *  The user is also cautioned that this function only erases
       *  the elements, and that if the elements themselves are
       *  pointers, the pointed-to memory is not touched in any way.
       *  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
