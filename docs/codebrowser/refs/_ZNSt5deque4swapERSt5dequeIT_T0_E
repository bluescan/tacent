       *  @brief  Swaps data with another %deque.
       *  @param  __x  A %deque of the same element and allocator types.
       *
       *  This exchanges the elements between two deques in constant time.
       *  (Four pointers, so it should be quite fast.)
       *  Note that the global std::swap() function is specialized such that
       *  std::swap(d1,d2) will feed to this function.
       *
       *  Whether the allocators are swapped depends on the allocator traits.
