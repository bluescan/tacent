       *  @brief  The constructor performs all the work.
       *  @param  __is  The input stream to guard.
       *  @param  __noskipws  Whether to consume whitespace or not.
       *
       *  If the stream state is good (@a __is.good() is true), then the
       *  following actions are performed, otherwise the sentry state
       *  is false (&lt;em&gt;not okay&lt;/em&gt;) and failbit is set in the
       *  stream state.
       *
       *  The sentry&apos;s preparatory actions are:
       *
       *  -# if the stream is tied to an output stream, @c is.tie()-&gt;flush()
       *     is called to synchronize the output sequence
       *  -# if @a __noskipws is false, and @c ios_base::skipws is set in
       *     @c is.flags(), the sentry extracts and discards whitespace
       *     characters from the stream.  The currently imbued locale is
       *     used to determine whether each character is whitespace.
       *
       *  If the stream state is still good, then the sentry state becomes
       *  true (@a okay).
