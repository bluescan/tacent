       *  This function erases an element, pointed to by the given iterator,
       *  from an %unordered_multimap.
       *  Note that this function only erases the element, and that if the
       *  element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched in
       *  any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
