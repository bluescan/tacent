       *  @brief  Swaps data with another %multimap.
       *  @param  __x  A %multimap of the same element and allocator types.
       *
       *  This exchanges the elements between two multimaps in constant time.
       *  (It is only swapping a pointer, an integer, and an instance of
       *  the @c Compare type (which itself is often stateless and empty), so it
       *  should be quite fast.)
       *  Note that the global std::swap() function is specialized such that
       *  std::swap(m1,m2) will feed to this function.
       *
       *  Whether the allocators are swapped depends on the allocator traits.
