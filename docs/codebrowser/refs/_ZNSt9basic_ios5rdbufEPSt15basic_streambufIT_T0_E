       *  @brief  Changing the underlying buffer.
       *  @param  __sb  The new stream buffer.
       *  @return  The previous stream buffer.
       *
       *  Associates a new buffer with the current stream, and clears the
       *  error state.
       *
       *  Due to historical accidents which the LWG refuses to correct, the
       *  I/O library suffers from a design error:  this function is hidden
       *  in derived classes by overrides of the zero-argument @c rdbuf(),
       *  which is non-virtual for hysterical raisins.  As a result, you
       *  must use explicit qualifications to access this function via any
       *  derived class.  For example:
       *
       *  @code
       *  std::fstream     foo;         // or some other derived type
       *  std::streambuf*  p = .....;
       *
       *  foo.ios::rdbuf(p);            // ios == basic_ios&lt;char&gt;
       *  @endcode
