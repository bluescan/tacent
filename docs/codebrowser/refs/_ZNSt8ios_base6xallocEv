     *  @brief  Access to unique indices.
     *  @return  An integer different from all previous calls.
     *
     *  This function returns a unique integer every time it is called.  It
     *  can be used for any purpose, but is primarily intended to be a unique
     *  index for the iword and pword functions.  The expectation is that an
     *  application calls xalloc in order to obtain an index in the iword and
     *  pword arrays that can be used without fear of conflict.
     *
     *  The implementation maintains a static variable that is incremented and
     *  returned on each invocation.  xalloc is guaranteed to return an index
     *  that is safe to use in the iword and pword arrays.
