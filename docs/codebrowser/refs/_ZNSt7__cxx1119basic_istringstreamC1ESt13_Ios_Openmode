       *  @brief  Starts with an empty string buffer.
       *  @param  __mode  Whether the buffer can read, or write, or both.
       *
       *  @c ios_base::in is automatically included in @a __mode.
       *
       *  Initializes @c sb using @c __mode|in, and passes @c &amp;sb to the base
       *  class initializer.  Does not allocate any buffer.
       *
       *  That&apos;s a lie.  We initialize the base class with NULL, because the
       *  string class does its own memory management.
