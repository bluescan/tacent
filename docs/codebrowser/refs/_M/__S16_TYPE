<doc f='include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/types.h' l='80'>/* The machine-dependent file &lt;bits/typesizes.h&gt; defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S&lt;SIZE&gt;_TYPE and __U&lt;SIZE&gt;_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- &quot;natural&quot; 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- &quot;natural&quot; 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- &quot;natural&quot; 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long&apos; or `long long&apos; type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long&apos; when it&apos;s 64 bits where `long long&apos; is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program&apos;s portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */</doc>
