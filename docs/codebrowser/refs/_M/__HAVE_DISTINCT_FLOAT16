   type is the first with its format in the sequence of (the default
   choices for) float, double, long double, _Float16, _Float32,
   _Float64, _Float128, _Float32x, _Float64x, _Float128x for this
   glibc; that is, if functions present once per floating-point format
   rather than once per type are present for this type.

   All configurations supported by glibc have _Float32 the same format
   as float, _Float64 and _Float32x the same format as double, the
   _Float64x the same format as either long double or _Float128.  No
   configurations support _Float128x or, as of GCC 7, have compiler
   support for a type meeting the requirements for _Float128x.  */</doc>
