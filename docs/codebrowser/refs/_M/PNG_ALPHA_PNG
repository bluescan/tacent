 * of a PNG file are returned to the calling application when an alpha channel,
 * or a tRNS chunk in a palette file, is present.
 *
 * This has no effect on the way pixels are written into a PNG output
 * datastream. The color samples in a PNG datastream are never premultiplied
 * with the alpha samples.
 *
 * The default is to return data according to the PNG specification: the alpha
 * channel is a linear measure of the contribution of the pixel to the
 * corresponding composited pixel, and the color channels are unassociated
 * (not premultiplied).  The gamma encoded color channels must be scaled
 * according to the contribution and to do this it is necessary to undo
 * the encoding, scale the color values, perform the composition and re-encode
 * the values.  This is the &apos;PNG&apos; mode.
 *
 * The alternative is to &apos;associate&apos; the alpha with the color information by
 * storing color channel values that have been scaled by the alpha.
 * image.  These are the &apos;STANDARD&apos;, &apos;ASSOCIATED&apos; or &apos;PREMULTIPLIED&apos; modes
 * (the latter being the two common names for associated alpha color channels).
 *
 * For the &apos;OPTIMIZED&apos; mode, a pixel is treated as opaque only if the alpha
 * value is equal to the maximum value.
 *
 * The final choice is to gamma encode the alpha channel as well.  This is
 * broken because, in practice, no implementation that uses this choice
 * correctly undoes the encoding before handling alpha composition.  Use this
 * choice only if other serious errors in the software or hardware you use
 * mandate it; the typical serious error is for dark halos to appear around
 * opaque areas of the composited PNG image because of arithmetic overflow.
 *
 * The API function png_set_alpha_mode specifies which of these choices to use
 * with an enumerated &apos;mode&apos; value and the gamma of the required output:
