 *
 * #defines to be used in png_image::format.  Each #define identifies a
 * particular layout of sample data and, if present, alpha values.  There are
 * separate defines for each of the two component encodings.
 *
 * A format is built up using single bit flag values.  All combinations are
 * valid.  Formats can be built up from the flag values or you can use one of
 * the predefined values below.  When testing formats always use the FORMAT_FLAG
 * macros to test for individual features - future versions of the library may
 * add new flags.
 *
 * When reading or writing color-mapped images the format should be set to the
 * format of the entries in the color-map then png_image_{read,write}_colormap
 * called to read or write the color-map and set the format correctly for the
 * image data.  Do not set the PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_COLORMAP bit directly!
 *
 * NOTE: libpng can be built with particular features disabled. If you see
 * compiler errors because the definition of one of the following flags has been
 * compiled out it is because libpng does not have the required support.  It is
 * possible, however, for the libpng configuration to enable the format on just
 * read or just write; in that case you may see an error at run time.  You can
 * guard against this by checking for the definition of the appropriate
 * &quot;_SUPPORTED&quot; macro, one of:
 *
 *    PNG_SIMPLIFIED_{READ,WRITE}_{BGR,AFIRST}_SUPPORTED
