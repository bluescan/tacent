       *  @brief  Fetches more data from the controlled sequence.
       *  @return  The first character from the &lt;em&gt;pending sequence&lt;/em&gt;.
       *
       *  Informally, this function is called when the input buffer is
       *  exhausted (or does not exist, as buffering need not actually be
       *  done).  If a buffer exists, it is @a refilled.  In either case, the
       *  next available character is returned, or @c traits::eof() to
       *  indicate a null pending sequence.
       *
       *  For a formal definition of the pending sequence, see a good text
       *  such as Langer &amp; Kreft, or [27.5.2.4.3]/7-14.
       *
       *  A functioning input streambuf can be created by overriding only
       *  this function (no buffer area will be used).  For an example, see
       *  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/streambufs.html
       *
       *  @note  Base class version does nothing, returns eof().
