       *  @brief  Extraction until the buffer is exhausted, but no more.
       *  @param  __s  A character array.
       *  @param  __n  Maximum number of characters to store.
       *  @return  The number of characters extracted.
       *
       *  Extracts characters and stores them into @a __s depending on the
       *  number of characters remaining in the streambuf&apos;s buffer,
       *  @c rdbuf()-&gt;in_avail(), called @c A here:
       *  - if @c A @c == @c -1, sets eofbit and extracts no characters
       *  - if @c A @c == @c 0, extracts no characters
       *  - if @c A @c &gt; @c 0, extracts @c min(A,n)
       *
       *  The goal is to empty the current buffer, and to not request any
       *  more from the external input sequence controlled by the streambuf.
