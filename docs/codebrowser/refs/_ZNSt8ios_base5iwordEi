     *  @brief  Access to integer array.
     *  @param  __ix  Index into the array.
     *  @return  A reference to an integer associated with the index.
     *
     *  The iword function provides access to an array of integers that can be
     *  used for any purpose.  The array grows as required to hold the
     *  supplied index.  All integers in the array are initialized to 0.
     *
     *  The implementation reserves several indices.  You should use xalloc to
     *  obtain an index that is safe to use.  Also note that since the array
     *  can grow dynamically, it is not safe to hold onto the reference.
