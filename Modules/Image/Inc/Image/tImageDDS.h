	// to get more detailed information. There are some results that are not full-success that leave the object valid.
	// When decoding _and_ reversing row order, most BC 4x4 blocks can be massaged without decompression to fix the row
	// order. The more complex ones like BC6 and BC7 cannot be swizzled around like this (well, they probably could be,
	// but it's a non-trivial amount of work).
	//
	// A note on LoadFlag_ReverseRowOrder. tImageDDS tries to perform row-reversing before any decode operation. This is
	// often possible even if the DDS texture data is BC-compressed. However, for some of the more complex BC schemes
	// (eg. BC6 BC7) this reversal cannot be easily accomplished without a full decode and re-encode which would be
	// lossy. In these cases the row-reversal is done _after_ decoding. Unfortunalely decoding may not always be
	// requested (for example if you want to pass the image data directly to the GPU memory in OpenGL). In these cases
	// tImageDDS will be unable to reverse the rows. You will still get a valid object, but it will be a conditional
	// valid (GetStates() will have Conditional_CouldNotFlipRows flag set). You can call also call RowsReversed() to
	// see if row-reversal was performed. The conditional is only set if reversal was requested.
