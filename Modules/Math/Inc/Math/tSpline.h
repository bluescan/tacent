//
// Implementations for splines and paths with various degrees of smoothness. A 'path', or 'spline', is arbitrarily long
// and may be composed of smaller path sections called 'curves'. For example, a Bezier path is made from multiple
// Bezier curves. Implementations for piecewise-linear paths, Hermite/Bezier curves and paths, and Nonuniform
// Nonrational Cubic-Basis splines can be found in this file.
//
// Regarding naming, the word 'spline' refers to any path that is composed of piecewise parts. Strictly speaking one
// could call a composite of multiple Bezier curves a 'Bezier Spline' but it is not a common term. In this file the
// word 'path' is used for a composite of Bezier curves or a composite of line segments, and we reserve the word spline
// for paths composed of multiple cubic polynomial pieces.
